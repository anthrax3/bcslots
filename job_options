1) expose endpoint, push addresses to that
pros: cheap (0 dollars)
cons: application split into more than one piece
could possibly run out if worker is not running

2) delayed job polling
pros : safest, "most correct" solution
cons : most expensive, ~35 per environment

3) delayed job on callback
mix between one and two (cheaper and one app)

4) event machine?

5) node?

6) in database?

7) thread?
